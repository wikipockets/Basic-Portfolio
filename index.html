               My name is Stephen Johnson, I am 24, working in the Commerical A/V field. I have a passion for creating art with non traditional mediums, like lasers. 
                 I am a charlotte native, born admist the throng of charlotte's banking boom. I grew up watching the city change around me from a fair city to a sprawling metropolis. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I found an intrest in art when I was young. Ever the builder, I had a large collection of legos and licoln logs. In school I began to play in band and continued on that path until graduation. I also was found of technology, growing up in the digital age has suited me just fine.
